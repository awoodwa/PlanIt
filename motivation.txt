Project proposal summary:

1. Potential users: residents and government
2. Primary use cases: 
	Determine cost of implementing renewable energy structures
		Provided suggested renewable structures ideal for region
		- if government, pull census data and energy per capita data
		- if resident, pull average monthly energy bill
	Prediction of cost to install suggested structures
	Predict money saved using forecasts
	Output moeny saved using renwable sources
3. Data we will be using:
	Solar radiation - 
	 1. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/solar-radiation
	 2. ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/nsrdb-solar/
	
	Wind data - 
	 1. https://data.nrel.gov/submissions/54
	 2. ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/source-datasets/	

	Census - 
	 1. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html#par_textimage_1383669527

	Energy per capita - 
	 1. https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/data.php?incfile=/state/seds/sep_sum/html/rank_use_capita.html&sid=US
	

Stretch goal:
	- Include regulations of states/cities
		allow residents to use wind 
	- Include gov subsidies
	- Take into account climate change trends for predicting savings
	- interactive wish list (timeline vs cost, percentage of energy from renwable sources) 
	- Take into account waterways
