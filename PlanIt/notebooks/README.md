# Notebooks

Here are a few notebooks that explain function structure and general use. Additional copies of `.py` modules are kept here for import purposes in Jupyter. We have also included a copy of the `data` directory so that interaction with the functions in the notebooks is similar to interaction with the functions outside the notebooks (`pd.read_csv(data/example.csv)`).
